joint source and channel coding (JSCC) was implemented through neural networks for transmitting images wirelessly. The JSCC demonstrated superior efficiency and accuracy compared to traditional separate coding methods, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios. However, the efficiency of JSCC in transmitting semantic information, even over noisy channels, raises concerns about potential privacy leakage. Eavesdroppers could exploit the robustness of JSCC to decode semantic information more easily, demanding a careful balance between transmission efficiency and security. Moreover, traditional security measures focused on preventing data interception may be insufficient as attackers can now aim to infer meaning from transmitted semantic features
