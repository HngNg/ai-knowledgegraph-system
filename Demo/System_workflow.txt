The workflow of the system involves two phases, training and deploying. In the training phase, a representative dataset is chosen and prepared, while the pair of encoder and decoder is designed and implemented. The network combining encoder and decoder is trained end-to-end using the dataset, and its performance is validated on a separate validation set to ensure generalization. After finishing the training process, the system comes to the deployment phase. In this phase, the trained encoder and decoder are deployed on the sender and receiver, respectively.
