Semantic communication (SC) is a revolutionary communication paradigm for developing 6G networks, focuses on transmitting the intended meaning of information rather than the precise bit-by-bit representation. SC aims to achieve superior transmission efficiency by reducing the amount of data transmitted over the physical channel, which is particularly beneficial for bandwidth-intensive applications such as high-resolution video transmission and augmented/virtual reality streaming. One of the key advantages of SC lies in its potential to surpass the limitations of traditional communication systems bound by Shannon's capacity limit. However, ensuring security at the physical layer in SC systems poses significant challenges. One major concern is the security of the common knowledge base, which is crucial for both the transmitter and receiver to extract and interpret semantic information, as any leakage or malicious modification of this shared knowledge could undermine the integrity of the entire communication process. Moreover, securing the transmission of the semantic information itself from eavesdropping and jamming attacks requires careful consideration and the development of new security mechanisms tailored to the characteristics of SC. Another concern is that the sender may not know the capabilities of the attackers and receivers beforehand, making it essential to consider the dynamic network conditions and the sophistication of potential attacks when designing secure SC systems. These challenges underscore the need for robust security measures at the physical layer to protect both the shared knowledge base and the transmitted semantic information in SC systems.
