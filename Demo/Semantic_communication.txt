The popularity of transmitting images wirelessly using semantic information has risen due to its communication efficiency. Existing Deep Learning-based systems for semantic communication, while efficient, face vulnerabilities to eavesdropping and unauthorized interpretation of semantic information. To address this issue, this paper presents a Deep Learning-based framework that enhances the security of semantic communication systems. Our framework implements a training process that involves encoder and decoder networks. These networks are trained to extract and transmit semantic features while minimizing the risk of privacy leakage. Through testing and simulations, we show that our method is effective and robust in preserving the confidentiality of semantic information during wireless transmission. This enhanced security framework opens new opportunities for secure and reliable communication of semantic information in diverse applications.
